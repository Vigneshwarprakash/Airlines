Project Description:

The project, titled "Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik," involves leveraging synthetic airline data to derive valuable insights using Qlik, a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool. This synthetic data simulates various aspects of airline operations, including flight schedules, passenger demographics, ticket sales, and performance metrics. The objective of this project is to use Qlik's analytical capabilities to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within this data, aiding decision-making processes for airlines, airports, and related stakeholders.

Process Overview:

Data Collection and Extraction: Data was sourced from Kaggle.
Data Preparation: The data was cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
Data Visualization: Various charts and graphs were created to represent the data visually.
Dashboard Creation: Interactive dashboards were developed to provide a comprehensive view of the data.
Storytelling: The data was presented in a narrative format to highlight key insights.
Performance Testing: The performance of the dashboards and visualizations was tested.
Project Documentation: Detailed documentation of the project was created.
Key Insights:

Total Number of Passengers: Displayed using a KPI chart.
Passengers Affected by Cancelled Flights: Shown using KPI charts.
Passengers Affected by Flight Delays: Illustrated using KPI charts.
Number of Flights On Time: Represented with a KPI chart.
Monthly Passenger Travel: Visualized with a bar chart.
Top 3 Months by Flight Status: Shown using a stacked bar chart.
Passenger Age Group by Gender: Displayed with a bar chart.
Continent-Wise Flight Status: Illustrated with a tree map.
Nation-Wise Passenger Analysis: Shown using a horizontal bar chart.
By using these different visualization charts, I developed two comprehensive dashboards. 

Here are some key insights gained from the data:

There is a noticeable trend in the number of passengers traveling during certain months, with peaks observed during holiday seasons.
Flight cancellations and delays have a significant impact on passenger satisfaction, with a high number of passengers affected during peak travel times.
Analysis of passenger demographics revealed that certain age groups and genders have distinct travel patterns.
The tree map visualization highlighted regional differences in fligh status, showing which continents experience more delays or cancellations.
